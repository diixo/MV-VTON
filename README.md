## News
- ðŸ”¥The first multi-view virtual try-on dataset MVG is now available.
- ðŸ”¥Checkpoints on both frontal-view and multi-view virtual try-on tasks are released.

## Overview

![](assets/framework.png)
> **Abstract:**  
> The goal of image-based virtual try-on is to generate an image of the target person naturally wearing the given
> clothing. However, most existing methods solely focus on the frontal try-on using the frontal clothing. When the views
> of the clothing and person are significantly inconsistent, particularly when the personâ€™s view is non-frontal, the
> results are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-View Virtual Try-ON (MV-VTON), which aims to
> reconstruct the dressing results of a person from multiple views using the given clothes. On the one hand, given that
> single-view clothes provide insufficient information for MV-VTON, we instead employ two images, i.e., the frontal and
> back views of the clothing, to encompass the complete view as much as possible. On the other hand, the diffusion
> models
> that have demonstrated superior abilities are adopted to perform our MV-VTON. In particular, we propose a
> view-adaptive
> selection method where hard-selection and soft-selection are applied to the global and local clothing feature
> extraction, respectively. This ensures that the clothing features are roughly fit to the personâ€™s view. Subsequently,
> we
> suggest a joint attention block to align and fuse clothing features with person features. Additionally, we collect a
> MV-VTON dataset, i.e., Multi-View Garment (MVG), in which each person has multiple photos with diverse views and
> poses.
> Experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on MV-VTON task using our MVG
> dataset, but also has superiority on frontal-view virtual try-on task using VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hywang2002/MV-VTON.git
cd MV-VTON
```

2. Install Python dependencies

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate mv-vton
```

3. Download the pretrained [vgg19_conv.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvow8jStPt8t2prDcSRlnf8yzXhrYeGo/view?usp=sharing)
   checkpoint and put it in `models/vgg/` for Multi-View VTON and `Frontal-View VTON/models/vgg/` for Frontal-View VTON.
4. Download the pretrained models **ckpt-mv.tar.gz**(6.8G) is `mvg.ckpt` via [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17SC8fHE5w2g7gEtzJgRRew?pwd=cshy) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J91PoT8A9yqHWNxkgRe6ZCnDEhN-H9O6/view?usp=sharing),

Put `mvg.ckpt` in `checkpoint/` and put `vitonhd.ckpt` in `Frontal-View VTON/checkpoint/`.


### Datasets

#### MVG

   contact `cshy2mvvton@outlook.com` with this form to get MVG dataset (
   Non-institutional emails (e.g. gmail.com) are not allowed. Please provide your institutional
   email address.).

After these, the folder structure should look like this (the warp_feat_unpair* only included in test directory):

```
â”œâ”€â”€ MVG

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [train | test]
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ image-wo-bg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cloth
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cloth-mask
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ warp_feat
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ warp_feat_unpair
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

#### VITON-HD

1. Download [VITON-HD](https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD) dataset
2. Download pre-warped cloth image/mask via [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uQM0IOltOmbeqwdOKX5kCw?pwd=cshy) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DTWfhxUnfg41nnwwpCKN--akC4eT9DM/view?usp=sharing) and
   put
   it under VITON-HD dataset.

```

### Inference

#### MVG

To test on paired settings (using `cp_dataset_mv_paired.py`), you can modify the `configs/viton512.yaml` and `main.py`,
or directly rename `cp_dataset_mv_paired.py` to `cp_dataset.py` (recommended). Then run:

```shell
sh test.sh
```

To test on unpaired settings, rename `cp_dataset_mv_unpaired.py` to `cp_dataset.py`, and do the same operation.

#### VITON-HD

To test on paired settings, input command `cd Frontal-View\ VTON/`, then directly run:

```shell
sh test.sh
```

To test on unpaired settings, input command `cd Frontal-View\ VTON/`, add `--unpaired` to `test.sh`, add then run:

```shell
sh test.sh
```

#### Metrics

We compute `LPIPS`, `SSIM`, `FID`, `KID` using the same tools in [LaDI-VTON](https://github.com/miccunifi/ladi-vton).

### Training

#### MVG

We use Paint-by-Example as initialization, please download the pretrained **model.ckpt** (4.9G)
from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15QzaTWsvZonJcXsNv-ilMRCYaQLhzR_i/view) and save the model to
directory `checkpoints`. Rename `cp_dataset_mv_paired.py` to `cp_dataset.py`, then run:

```shell
sh train.sh
```

#### VITON-HD

Input command `cd Frontal-View\ VTON/`, then directly run:

```shell
sh train.sh
```
